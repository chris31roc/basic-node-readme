    README Generator
    
    # Description
    Learning the basics of node by learning to create a README.md file!
    
    # Reason
    The reason for this project was to get myself acclimated to using node and learning how to install npm packages like inquirer. Also I found that learning to do such a task helped me breakdown node and figure out what I'm looking at in the back end of programming!
